<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
<!DOCTYPE html> defines that this document is an HTML5 document
<html></html>    Everything inside it is considered part of the web page.
<head>    It contains metadata (data about the page), not visible directly on the webpage. 
       Things like title, styles, scripts, SEO information, etc., go here.  

<body>      Everything inside <body> is visible to the user in the browser.
      This is where you add headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, etc.        -->
